# employees-data-analysis
The code provided is an example of how to preprocess the dataset and address missing values.

Importing libraries:

The import pandas as pd statement imports the pandas library, which is commonly used for data manipulation and analysis.
The import numpy as np statement imports the numpy library, which provides numerical computing functionality.
Loading the dataset:

The data = pd.read_csv('myexcel.csv') line reads the dataset from the CSV file named "employee_dataset.csv" and assigns it to the variable data.
Make sure to replace 'myexcel.csv' with the correct file path or name of your dataset file.
Replacing incorrect data in the "Height" column:

The data['Height'] = np.random.randint(150, 181, size=len(data)) line generates random integer values between 150 and 180 for the "Height" column.
It uses the np.random.randint() function from the numpy library to generate the random values.
The size=len(data) part ensures that the random values are generated for the same number of rows as the dataset.
Handling missing values:

The data.fillna('', inplace=True) line replaces any missing values in the dataset with an empty string ('').
The fillna() function from pandas is used to fill the missing values.
The inplace=True parameter ensures that the changes are made directly to the data DataFrame without creating a new DataFrame.
By performing these preprocessing steps, the code snippet prepares the dataset by replacing incorrect data in the "Height" column with random values and handling any missing values by filling them with empty strings.

explanation of each data analysis task:

1.Calculate the number of employees in each team and the percentage splitting with respect to the total employees:

The code snippet uses the value_counts() function to count the occurrences of each team in the 'Team' column.
Then, it calculates the percentage split by dividing each team count by the total number of employees and multiplying by 100.
The results are displayed in a DataFrame named team_stats with columns 'Team', 'Count', and 'Percentage'.

2.Segregate the employees based on different positions:
The code snippet again uses value_counts() to count the occurrences of each position in the 'Position' column.
The results are displayed as a Series, where the index represents the positions and the values represent the count of employees.

3.Determine the age group with the most employees:
The code snippet creates age groups using the pd.cut() function, which bins the 'Age' column into different ranges defined by age_bins and assigns labels to each range.
It then uses value_counts() to count the occurrences of each age group in the 'Age Group' column.
The results are displayed as a Series with the count of employees in each age group.

4.Identify the team and position where the spending in terms of salary is high:
The code groups the data by 'Team' and 'Position' columns using groupby() and calculates the total salary for each group using sum().
It finds the maximum salary value and retrieves the corresponding team and position from the DataFrame.
The team with the highest spending is stored in highest_spending_team, and the position with the highest spending is stored in highest_spending_position.

5.Find if there is any correlation between age and salary and represent it visually:
The code removes rows with missing salary values using dropna() and creates a new DataFrame named salary_data.
It converts the 'Salary' column to the float data type using astype(float).
The code then plots a scatter plot using plt.scatter() with 'Age' on the x-axis and 'Salary' on the y-axis.
This scatter plot visually represents the correlation between age and salary for the employees.
These code snippets analyze the dataset and provide insights into the number of employees in each team, the distribution of positions, the age group with the most employees, the team and position with the highest spending, and the correlation between age and salary.
